Title: BDD algorithms and proofs in Coq, by reflection
Author: Kumar Neeraj Verma
Institution: Dyade/INRIA projet Coq/IIT Delhi
Date: May-July 1999
Description: Provides BDD algorithms running under Coq.
        (BDD are Binary Decision Diagrams.)
        Allows one to do classical validity checking by
        reflection in Coq using BDDs, can also be used
        to get certified BDD algorithms by extraction.
        First step towards actual symbolic model-checkers
        in Coq.  See file README for operation.
Keywords: BDD binary decision diagram classical propositional
        logic validity satisfiability model-checking reflection
